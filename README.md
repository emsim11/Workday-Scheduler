## Description

The Workday Scheduler application is a simple calendar website that allows users to save events for each hour of a typical workday (9am–5pm). The application runs in the browser and uses local storage to retain the user's saved events.

### User Story

```md
As an employee with a busy schedule

I want to add important events to a daily planner

So that I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
Given I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

When I open the planner

Then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

When I scroll down

Then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm

When I view the time blocks for that day

Then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

When I click into a time block

Then I can enter an event

When I click the save button for that time block

Then the text for that event is saved in local storage

When I refresh the page

Then the saved events persist
```
